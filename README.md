In this work time series data is forecasted using autoregressive models, recurrent neural networks, and hybrid decomposition based model combining adaptive data analysis with recurrent neural networks.

The adaptive data analysis methods considered in the thesis are the EMD [The empirical mode decomposition and the Hilbert spectrum for nonlinear and non-stationary time series analysis](10.1098/rspa.1998.0193), the compressive sensing based method of [Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895), and the partial differential equation based method of [Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895)
